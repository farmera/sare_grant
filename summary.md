### 10 - Summary

#### Study Justification

For any Louisiana cane grower, achieving the best possible crop yield at the lowest possible cost is the goal. In practice, 
growers face numerous challenges that impact this objective. Such challenges may cause or compound inefficiencies downstream 
in terms of the local sugar mill operating costs. The result is a higher risk of mills being negatively impacted and 
the overall profit and long term health of the industry being compromised.

A need exists for reliable and actionable information that can aid Louisiana sugarcane growers and affected stakeholders 
in order to better optimize sugarcane growth, harvesting and milling operations. This study employed low-cost remote sensing and 
GIS technology to monitor sugarcane crop performance and sucrose yield in the southwest Louisiana.

#### Summary

A traditional limitation of remote sensing in agriculture has been the cost and complexity of acquiring satellite imagery.
While low cost Landsat 8 imagery is available without its resolution (at 30 m per pixel) and lack of timeliness make it
untenable. Successful crop monitoring requires clear imagery with regular coverage.

Time series analyses (month-to-month) adds value to traditional crop monitoring practice. It allows farmers to monitor and 
understand how crops perform over time by comparing previous trends with establish patterns. Such analysis has the capability 
of picking up field anomalies not otherwise apparent on the ground (e.g. infestations, nutrient deficiencies, weather effects, 
theft, erosion, diseases, etc).
