* Gerald McCollam conceived and wrote the grant, performed the UAV flights, processed the imagery, carried out the statistical 
analysis, contributed to the design of experimental plot sections, worked on costs and comparisons between platforms, and wrote the manuscript.  
* Slattery McCollam provided dedicated access to the study site for the grant period.
* Dr. Richard Johnson proposed the field trialâ€™s design and helped with editorial contributions.
* Dr Chris Fastie ...  
* [Brazilian woman] supported in development and measurements.

#### Cost Analysis

Direct comparison of specific costs for the three platforms described in this report is entirely feasible due to the 
different...

In this study we chose a top-down approach to account for all the expenses associated with data acquisition and processing, 
grouped into three broad categories:
* __Acquisition costs__ 
    * All expenses required to get the raw images. 
    * Expenses for the deployment of the sensor platform and payload.
* __Georeferencing and Orthorectification__ 
    * Includes man-hour costs to obtain a geo-referenced and ortho-rectified image. 
* __Image processing__ 
    * Covers all corrections and elaborations, priced in man-hours, needed to get the final result. 

The processes listed are  similar for each platform, the difference being in the different resolution and compute time.
