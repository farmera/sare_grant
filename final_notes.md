#### Cost Analysis

In this study we chose a top-down approach to account for all the expenses associated with data acquisition and processing, 
grouped into three broad categories:
* __Acquisition costs__ 
    * All expenses required to get the raw images. 
    * Expenses for the deployment of the sensor platform and payload.
* __Georeferencing and Orthorectification__ 
    * Includes man-hour costs to obtain a geo-referenced and ortho-rectified image. 
* __Image processing__ 
    * Covers all corrections and elaborations, priced in man-hours, needed to get the final result. 

The processes listed are  similar for each platform, the difference being in the different resolution and compute time.
