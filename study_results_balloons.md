### 8 - Results Using Balloons and Kites

#### Introduction

When our project was initiated the plan was to use methods that are readily available to anyone and to apply these in 
ways that do not impose a high barrier in terms of time and materials. Farmers are generally very practical regarding the 
kind of tool they are willing to try in order to solve a problem. Most are eager to learn a new method if it helps solve 
a long-standing issue more efficiently. As an example, crop scouting has existed as long as farming, and its methods 
have changed very little except that what was once done on foot or by horse is now done in a pick-up truck.

#### Image capture and preparation

With that sentiment in mind we discuss results obtained by experimenting with aerial photography using a kite or a balloon. 
__Figure 3__ is a RGB composite stitched together 'by hand' with the help of ground control points (GCPs) 
spray-painted into the field. Having GCPs in a set of images like this is critical to both stitch together a larger image and to compare image sets over successive days. To support this
process we used an open source software known as [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/). Fiji is an image processing 
package that bundles an incredible variety of plugins to facilitate scientific image analysis.  

To determine the height of a flight we carefully measured and marked the kite's flight line. This set of 
captures was taken at a height of 125ft. Maintaining a steady altitude like this with a kite can be a challenge when the 
wind is variable. 

#### JPEG versus RAW Format

The RAW format captures everything without pre-processing while JPEG does not...

A source of artifact for JPEG images in spectral index preparation is compression and band distortion. Digital Image 
Compression (DIC) addresses issues of storage and transmission since storage space is at a premium in any consumer-grade 
camera. For our purposes, image compression and band distortion are less features than problems to be corrected. Compression 
and band distortion occur in the camera during capture and can impact the ability to utilize _all_ bandwidth data in 
post-processing. JPEG files are automatically pre-processed in the camera though exactly how this occurs varies from 
model to model. Disabling this feature is not a ready option. 
 
While some consumer cameras support the RAW image format, RAW images are much larger and a problem during flight. 
For this reason our results using consumer cameras are based on the JPEG format. How to accurately calibrate for reflectance 
under changing illuminant conditions while still being limited to JPEG is another issue. Finally, lack of accurate 
geo-tagging support in most consumer cameras can mean no consistent source of reference regarding the planar as well as 
the vertical positioning of the camera with respect to the field. A hand-held GPS device was used to create the ground
control points in these images but it was not always possible to use geo-tags in images to match each capture with a known position 
on the ground. 

Having obtained a set of images we then scripted a process in Fiji to help align, stitch and create the vegetation index.

#### Summary

Early in the project we experimented with various capture systems (automatically-triggered cameras) and suspension methods 
using kites and balloons. The central challenge of an aerial system based on wind alone is variability in the 
control of height and nadir positioning of the camera. Wind can impact the performance of a balloon during flight. 
Additional factors to consider are payload weight and total flight time.
