### 8 - Results Using Balloons and Kites

#### Introduction

When our project began the plan was to use methods that are readily available to anyone and to apply these in 
ways that do not impose a high barrier in terms of time and materials. Farmers are generally practical with regard to the 
kinds of tools they are willing to try. Most are eager to learn a new method if it helps solve 
a long-standing problem more efficiently. 

As an example, crop scouting has existed as long as farming has and its methods 
have changed little except what was once done on foot or by horse is now done in a pick-up truck. If a kite and a camera 
can do the same work while adding more information then chances are these tools will be adopted. With that sentiment in 
mind we discuss results obtained by experimenting with kites and balloons

#### Image capture and preparation

__Figure 1__ is a RGB composite image captured with a kite and stitched together 'by hand' with the help of ground control points (GCPs) 
spray-painted into the field. Having GCPs in a set of images like this is crucial both for stitching together the final 
image and for comparing image sets over time. To support this process we used an open source software known as 
[Fiji](https://fiji.sc/). Fiji is an image processing package that bundles an incredible variety of plugins to facilitate 
scientific image analysis.  

To determine the height of a flight we carefully measured and marked the kite's flight line. This set of 
captures was taken at a height of about 125ft. Maintaining a steady altitude like this with a kite can be a challenge when the 
wind is variable. This was a key challenge faced with kites. 

#### JPEG versus RAW Format

In addition to challenges imposed by weather there are those associated with the choice of camera, especially the choice of 
image format. A common default for consumer cameras is JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group). The JPEG format in many cameras 
has processing built in at the time of capture, to adjust contrast, reduce noise or brighten and sharpen the image before 
rendering it to a file. These processing steps are intended to render images that are visually appealing 
to the human eye. As a result pixel values of a JPG-processed image lack a 'true' relationship with the intensity of light 
that originally impinges on the sensor. Details regarding how a JPEG file is processed by a particular camera are not easy 
to come by and disabling such 'features' is usually not a practical option.

Other sources of artifact in JPEG images are compression and band distortion. Digital Image 
Compression (DIC) attempts to address the issue of storage and transmission since space is usually at a premium in a consumer-grade 
camera. For our purposes, image pre-processing, compression and band distortion are less features than issues to be corrected. 
They impact an ability to utilize _all_ the bandwidth data in post-processing.

As an alternative, some consumer cameras support the RAW format, which preserves all of the bandwidth data. However, RAW images are larger 
than JPEGs and the rate of capture required during flight (to achieve an acceptable ground resolution) makes their
use prohibitive. For this reason our results using consumer cameras are based on the JPEG format. How to accurately calibrate for reflectance 
under changing illuminant conditions while limited to JPEG is an issue that has been addressed by others (for excellent
work in this area see Public Lab postings [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-10-2014/using-a-raw-image-to-calibrate-a-jpeg-image)
and [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/06-30-2015/automating-ndvi-calibration)). 

Finally, the lack of accurate geo-tagging support in most consumer cameras means there's no reliable source of reference regarding planar or 
vertical positioning of the camera with respect to the ground. A hand-held GPS device was used to create the ground
control points in these images but it was not always possible 'geo-tag' and match each capture with a known position 
on the ground. Having obtained a set of images we then scripted a process in Fiji to help align, stitch and create the vegetation index.  
   
#### Post-processing JPEG images from a kite flight.
Details regarding how to create a vegetation index such as NDVI using the Fiji software package are described in detail by Chris Fastie
and Ned Horning on Public Lab's website [here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-monitoring-plugin) and 
[here](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/5-31-2012/registering-and-processing-photos-acquired-two-cameras). 
The [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/) community has been a leader in this field and the information they have compiled 
over the years has served both as inspiration and as a guide throughout our work.

###### Figure 2. NDVI image processed using Fuji. This image was captured with a Delta kite at a height of 125ft.
__Figure 2__ is an NDVI index derived from RGB and NIR sets using a pair of modified consumer cameras. It was taken 
from a height of about about 125 ft early in the growth season. The vertical LUT displays NDVI values between 0.45 and 0.60. 
This particular image shows an interesting effect that we saw throughout while using our dual-camera NDVI system. The NDVI 
values of soil (here partially covered by chaff) show values in the lower range (0.45) compared to the green areas of early 
growth. 

At lower altitudes our dual-camera system tended to record non-vegetation sources somewhat lower than at higher altitudes while
it remained consistent in terms of vegetation values.

#### Ground Resolution Issues

Various factors contribute to the overall resolution of an image taken from the air. Of interest in our study 
was the ground sampling distance, i.e. the distance between pixel centers measured on the ground. It was desirable 
to have as small a GSD as possible as the advantage of images captured by kite or balloon (or drone) is their ability to 
fly low (hence improving resolution). A disadvantage of traditional methods such as planes and satellites 
is their high flight, low resolution.  

![](img/pixel-sizes.png)
###### Figure 4. Relative pixel dimension depending on satellite image source provider.

For example, the GSD of a Landsat satellite image is ~30m (b. in __Figure 4__). This means that the smallest unit that maps to a single pixel 
in Landsat is 30m x 30m (i.e. 900 sq meters, 0.22 acres, ~8% of our total study area). Each of our thirty test sections 
measures 100ft by 20ft (a. in __Figure 4__) thus a single pixel in Landsat is five times larger than a single section. 

Commercial satellite imagery is available for a price at higher resolution (e.g. from providers like Planet Labs with a 
GSD of 5 m, or a pixel size of roughly 250 sq ft, c. in __Figure 4__). The GeoEye-1 satellite offers the highest resolution per pixel at a little 
over 1 sq ft per pixel.

Commercial providers of satellite image data charge for their services (Landsat is free) and there is often a delay 
between successive captures. In addition to cost and generally low-resolution GSD, cloud-cover and other atmospheric effects present significant issues for 
any satellite or airplane data service provider. 

#### Minimum Resolution for Study

All resolutions we have discussed are for standard RGB imagery. For multi-spectral imagery bands including NIR 
the resolutions drop somewhat (in some cases by as much as 25%) so RGB is higher than when all bands are taken together. 
Our choice of a pair of Canon S100's meant a high pixel count with flight altitudes between 100 and 200 ft. At these heights 
our GSD using the dual-camera system was from 3-5 sq in or between 0.06-0.17 sq ft per pixel.

To put this into perspective consider the images in __Figure 5__. The top image shows a more accurate depiction of a 1 meter
per pixel GSD resolution. This means that each pixel covers an area on the ground of 1 sq meter (just under 11 sq ft)

#### Summary

Early in the project we experimented with various automatically-triggered cameras and suspension systems 
using kites and balloons. The central challenge of an aerial system based on wind alone is variability in the 
control of height and nadir positioning of the camera. Wind can impact the performance of a balloon during flight. 
Additional factors to consider are payload weight and total flight time.
