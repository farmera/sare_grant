### 8 - Results Using Balloons and Kites

#### Introduction

When our project began the plan was to use methods that are readily available to anyone and to apply these in 
ways that do not impose a high barrier in terms of time and materials. Farmers are generally practical with regard to the 
kinds of tools they are willing to try. Most are eager to learn a new method if it helps solve 
a long-standing problem more efficiently. 

As an example, crop scouting has existed as long as farming has and its methods 
have changed little except what was once done on foot or by horse is now done in a pick-up truck. If a kite and a camera 
can do the same work while adding more information then chances are these tools will be adopted. With that sentiment in 
mind we discuss results obtained by experimenting with kites and balloons

#### Image capture and preparation

__Figure 1__ is a RGB composite image captured with a kite and stitched together 'by hand' with the help of ground control points (GCPs) 
spray-painted into the field. Having GCPs in a set of images like this is crucial both for stitching together the final 
image and for comparing image sets over time. To support this process we used an open source software known as 
[Fiji](https://fiji.sc/). Fiji is an image processing package that bundles an incredible variety of plugins to facilitate 
scientific image analysis.  

To determine the height of a flight we carefully measured and marked the kite's flight line. This set of 
captures was taken at a height of about 100ft. Maintaining a steady altitude like this with a kite can be a challenge when the 
wind is variable. This was a key challenge faced with kites. 

#### JPEG versus RAW Format

In addition to challenges imposed by weather there are those associated with the choice of camera, especially the choice of 
image format. A common default for consumer cameras is JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group). The JPEG format in many cameras 
has processing built in at the time of capture, to adjust contrast, reduce noise or brighten and sharpen the image before 
rendering it to a file. These processing steps are intended to render images that are visually appealing 
to the human eye. As a result pixel values of a JPG-processed image lack a 'true' relationship with the intensity of light 
that originally impinges on the sensor. Details regarding how a JPEG file is processed by a particular camera are not easy 
to come by and disabling such 'features' is usually not a practical option.

Other sources of artifact in JPEG images are compression and band distortion. Digital Image 
Compression (DIC) attempts to address the issue of storage and transmission since space is usually at a premium in a consumer-grade 
camera. For our purposes, image pre-processing, compression and band distortion are less features than issues to be corrected. 
They impact an ability to utilize _all_ the bandwidth data in post-processing.

As an alternative, some consumer cameras support the RAW format, which preserves all of the bandwidth data. However, RAW images are larger 
than JPEGs and the rate of capture required during flight (to achieve an acceptable ground resolution) makes their
use prohibitive. For this reason our results using consumer cameras are based on the JPEG format. How to accurately calibrate for reflectance 
under changing illuminant conditions while limited to JPEG is an issue that has been addressed by others (for excellent
work in this area see Public Lab postings [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-10-2014/using-a-raw-image-to-calibrate-a-jpeg-image)
and [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/06-30-2015/automating-ndvi-calibration)). 

Finally, the lack of accurate geo-tagging support in most consumer cameras means there's no reliable source of reference regarding planar or 
vertical positioning of the camera with respect to the ground. A hand-held GPS device was used to create the ground
control points in these images but it was not always possible 'geo-tag' and match each capture with a known position 
on the ground. Having obtained a set of images we then scripted a process in Fiji to help align, stitch and create the vegetation index.  
   
#### Post-processing JPEG images from a kite flight.
Details regarding how to create a vegetation index such as NDVI using the Fiji software package are described in detail by Chris Fastie
and Ned Horning on Public Lab's website [here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-monitoring-plugin) and 
[here](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/5-31-2012/registering-and-processing-photos-acquired-two-cameras). 
The [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/) community has been a leader in this field and the information they have compiled 
over the years has served both as inspiration and as a guide throughout our work.

Various factors contribute to the overall resolution of an image taken from the air. Of interest in our study 
was the ground sampling distance, i.e. the distance between pixel centers measured on the ground. It was desirable 
to have as small a GSD as possible as the advantage of images captured by kite or balloon (or drone) is their ability to 
fly low (hence improving resolution). A disadvantage of traditional methods such as planes and satellites 
is their low resolution.  

For example, the GSD of a Landsat satellite image is ~30m. This means that the smallest unit that maps to a single pixel 
in Landsat is 30m x 30m (i.e. 900 sq meters, 0.22 acres, ~8% of our total study area). Each of our thirty test sections 
measures 100ft by 60ft thus a single pixel in Landsat is 3000 sq ft larger than a single section plot in our study. The most
recent commercial satellite available (GeoEye 1) has a GSD of 0.41 m, or a pixel size of roughyl 20 sq ft. 

The contribution made by an imaging sensor to achieve sufficient ground sampling distance (GSD) i.e. the size of the smallest 
element distinguishable, formed part of our initial assessment of cameras. The GSD is determined by the height attained by the sensor above ground, by 
the focal length of the lens, and by pixel size. Our choice of a Canon S100 meant a high pixel count but 
a higher pixel count does not guarantee a higher ground resolution.

#### Summary

Early in the project we experimented with various automatically-triggered cameras and suspension systems 
using kites and balloons. The central challenge of an aerial system based on wind alone is variability in the 
control of height and nadir positioning of the camera. Wind can impact the performance of a balloon during flight. 
Additional factors to consider are payload weight and total flight time.
