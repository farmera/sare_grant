### 8 - Results Using Balloons and Kites

#### Introduction

When our project was initiated the plan at the outset was to use methods that are readily available 
to anyone and to apply these in ways that do not impose a high barrier in terms of time and materials. 
Farmers are generally very practical regarding the kind of tool they are willing to try in order to solve a 
problem. Most are eager to learn a new method if it helps solve a long-standing issue more efficiently. As an example, crop 
scouting has existed as long as farming has and its methods have changed very little except that what was once done on foot or 
by horse is now done in a pick-up truck.

#### Image capture and preparation

With that sentiment in mind we discuss results obtained by experimenting with aerial photography using a kite or a balloon. 
__Figure 3__ is a RGB composite stitched together 'by hand' with the help of ground control points (GCPs) 
spray-painted into the field. Having GCPs in a set of images like this was critical to our 
ability both to stitch together a larger image and to compare image sets over successive days. To support this
process we used an open source software known as [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/). Fiji is an image processing 
package which bundles an incredible variety of plugins to facilitate scientific image analysis.  

To determine the height of a flight we carefully measured and marked the kite's flight line. This set of 
captures was taken at a height of 150ft. Maintaining a steady altitude like this with a kite can be a challenge when the 
wind is variable. 

Another issue is lack of accurate geotagging support in most consumer cameras. While most cameras support 
this feature, in practice we found it to be inconsistent as a reliable source of reference regarding the planar as well 
as vertical positioning of the camera with respect to the field. A hand-held GPS device was used to create the ground
control points but it was not always possible to use geotagging of images to match each capture with a known position 
on the ground. 

Having obtained a set of images we then scripted a process in Fiji to help align, stitch and create the vegetation index.

#### Summary

Early in the project we experimented with various capture systems (automatically-triggered cameras) and suspension methods 
using kites and balloons. The central challenge of an aerial system based on wind alone is variability in the 
control of height and nadir positioning of the camera. Wind can impact the performance of a balloon during flight. 
Additional factors to consider are payload weight and total flight time.
