### 2 - Through the Eyes of a Plant

#### Basic Plant Biology

* Plants use chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide to synthesize sugar. Sugars make the plant.
* Chloroplasts cells contain chlorophyll which absorbs light, mainly in red and blue wavelengths.

While our study's purpose was to provide an assessment regarding use of aerial tools for determining the health 
and productivity of sugar cane, before discussing our approach, we first discuss basic principles of what such 
systems measure and how they achieve their results. 

Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to synthesize sugar from carbon dioxide and water. 
The leaves of a plant contain photosynthetic engines called chloroplasts. When sunlight hits these cells they absorb the 
red and blue wavelengths of light while reflecting away most of the others. Thus it is __filtered light__, along with water 
and carbon dioxide, that produces sugar for the plant and oxygen for the environment.

#### Blue, Green, Red and Near Infra Red (NIR)

* Healthy plants absorb red and blue but reflect away most of the NIR light.

Light visible to the human eye lies roughly between 380 and 750 nanometers (nm) along the continuous electromagnetic spectrum. 
Plants are also receptive to light, although the mechanism involved is quite distinct from humans. The more healthy a 
plant is - i.e. the more photosynthesis it carries out - the more red light it will tend to absorb. This tendency is 
directly related to the functional health of choloroplast cells within the plant since these are the locus of the photosynthetic process. 

If a plant's chloroplasts are compromised then it will absorb less red light and more NIR light, and its ability to 
photosynthesize and produce sugar will be diminished. Plants also absorb a lot of blue light, in fact they absorb more blue than red, however the rate of photosynthesis is higher
in red light.

In addition to absorbing red (and blue) and reflecting green, most healthy plants tend to reflect away most of 
the NIR light. This tendency is shown in the graph above. NIR light is not in the human visible spectrum 
and neither may plants convert the higher energy of NIR to useful work. It is in part to avoid the 
damage that NIR otherwise causes that plants reflect most of it away. 

In the above graph, reflectance values are on the 'y' (vertical) axis while the wavelength of light is on the 'x' 
(horizontal) axis. In healthy plants blue light is largely absorbed and only a little is reflected. As we move further 
into the green we see that the amount of reflectance increases. In the red it is again diminished while in the NIR 
(the grey region) almost all is reflected away. 

In addition to showing the generic 'spectral signature' of plants this graph also indicates the difference 
between plants that are healthy and those that are not, in terms of spectral signature. The blue line indicates 
health while red demonstrates unhealth. Note that an unhealthy plant absorbs less in the blue 
and red parts of the spectrum while absorbing more (reflecting less) in the NIR portion.   
 

#### Consumer RGB Cameras
* Spectral bands collected by RGB cameras overlap. 
* Spectral overlap leads to contaminated values.
* Modified RGB cameras are difficult to calibrate.

So how does one 'see' the sorts of spectral signatures that crops exhibit? An obvious start (discussed [here](study_methods.md)
at length) is to get the right sort of camera high into the air and take a lot of pictures.
In a market that's rapidly evolving knowing how to choose the right camera at reasonable cost can be a challenge.

In a sense all cameras are multi-spectral insofar as they capture more than a single band of light. The typical consumer
camera is multi-spectral, sensing light in the red, green and blue parts of the spectrum. Consumer cameras as a rule do 
not capture light outside of the familiar RGB range. Or do they? In fact any standard Canon Powershot (the kind you can 
find on Ebay for $100) in fact __does__ capture NIR light but this capacity has been concealed by the manufacturer (to 
reinstate it just remove the filter). Suffice it to say that mass production provides digital sensors with a very 
high degree of often unrealized sophistication.
 
While consumer cameras can be 'hacked' such that they absorb both visible and NIR light, a problem in doing this is 
demonstrated by the following graphic:

###### Figure 2.

__Figure 2__ highlights the spectral characteristic of a generic consumer camera. What this graph shows is that the spectral 
sensitivity of a consumer camera's sensor is not especially specific to each band, i.e. the bands overlap to a degree. In addition,
each band is fairly broad, for example the red and green bands are more than 100nm wide while the blue is somewhat less so. 
Consumer cameras are not designed to separate these bands which is perfectly fine in the context of taking most pictures. 
When the intended goal is to provide separation for purposes of quantifying values of each band it's not ideal. 

#### Professional Multi-Spectral Cameras

* Multispectral cameras are tuned to capture multiple, narrow bands of light.
* The 'spectral signature' of a plant helps indicate its productivity.

An alternative to consumer-grade RGB cameras is a more expensive 
camera designed from the ground up to function as a truly narrow-band multi-spectral instrument.

###### Figure 3.

Specialized multispectral cameras contain 'band-pass' filters which whittle down the wavelengths of light to more 
narrow bands. Having access to these narrower bands provides a far more precise estimate of the luminosity of 
light reflecting off of plants.    

#### Summary

In sections to come we go into greater detail about specific low and high end multi-spectral cameras including examples 
of each in action. We'll also discuss how to scale and manage large volumes of image data in this sort of workflow.  Finally, 
we'll consider along with strategies for interpreting various vegetation indices under differing environmental conditions. 
Luckily, open-source software and image processing tools exist to make these tasks more accessible to the average user.
