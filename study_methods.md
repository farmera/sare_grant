### Study Methods

###### Introduction

This section describes the variety of tools and methods used to arrive 
at a final assessment of the most productive methodology for acquiring and interpreting multi-spectral data in sugar cane. It also describes 
some of the challenges involved in gathering and interpreting such data. The final results of our study are 
presented in [Section 8](study_results_balloons.md) and [Section 9](readme_resources/study_results_drones.md). 

In general, the goal of acquiring accurate aerial image data 
requires consideration of two fundamental questions: 

1. How to place a camera at the correct height and orientation for a sufficient period of time.

    * In [Section 3](kites_balloons_drones.md) we considered three possible methods for getting a camera 
    into the air: a kite, a helium-filled balloon, and an aerial drone. Each was shown to have its advantages and disadvantages.
    
2. How to acquire sufficient spectral detail from a camera such that the captured data may be usefully analyzed.

    * The phrase 'sufficient spectral detail' will be unpacked but essentially this means clear separation of the individual bands of light.  
    
Bottom line: the type of camera and the attributes of the data generated by that camera are critical. These ideas are covered in detail in this section.  
    

###### More on Plant Biology

* Creating an effective spectral index requires capturing the right sort of light, at the right time of day. 
* Interpreting spectral indices requires capturing data at the right time in the growing season.
* Thoughts on qualitative versus quantitative science.

In [Section 3](kites_balloons_drones.md) we learned some of the basics 
about various bands of reflected and captured light and how they may be used to facilitate an understanding about crop health. In a 
[Section 5]() we will consider in greater detail how such principles allow us to 
manipulate various bands to reveal more interesting and specific patterns. Here we will focus on general 
principles which makes all of this possible.

Earlier we learned about a set of images that were captured using a pair of consumer cameras. These were later processed to produce both an NRG
image along with a final index image, known as an NDVI index. The mathematical expression used to create an NDVI index 
is as follows:

__(NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red) =  NDVI__

This expression says "subtract the red from the NIR band in the numerator, add the same red band to the NIR in the denominator, 
find the quotient between the two." With this knowledge let's create a couple of sample NDVI calculations:

Assume that the amount of visible red light reflected from the tree on the left in __Figure 1__ is 8% and that the amount of NIR 
reflected is 50%. In this case we'd have the following NDVI expression: 

(0.5 - 0.08)/(0.5 + 0.08) = 0.42/0.58 = __0.72__ 

An NDVI value of 0.72 (on a scale of 0 to 1.0) indicates that the tree on the left is doing well. It's reflecting 8% of the red light away while absorbing 
the remaining 92% for photosynthesis. It's also reflecting more than half of the harmful NIR light away. 
This is a generic spectral pattern that we can use: _higher NDVI values correlate with healthier, more productive plants_. 

Consider the same equation applied to the tree on the right of __Figure 1__. 
  
(0.4 - 0.3)/(0.4 + 0.3) = 0.1/0.7 = __0.14__ 

Compared with the tree on the left, this one is doing poorly. It's absorbing more than half of the NIR 
light while reflecting away a good portion of the red. Recall that plants use red light to power photosynthesis while NIR 
light presents a physiological burden to them. This is another generic spectral pattern that we can use: _lower NDVI values correlate with unhealthy, distressed plants_.
